    A nucleic acid sequence is a succession of letters that indicate the order of nucleotides within a DNA (using GACT)
    or RNA (GACU) molecule. For this mission we are interested in DNA and "GACT" sequence.
    The possible letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand
    — adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine — covalently linked to a phosphodiester backbone.

    In this mission you should split a sequence at several parts by length,
    sort them by numbers of inversion and join them in one sequence again.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of letters "A", "C", "G" and "T" and length of subsequences.
    First you need split the given sequence by the given length. If last part is shorter, then drop it.
    Then sort these subsequences by numbers of the inversion.
    The number of inversion is a number of pairs of entries that are out of the alphabetic order with respect
    to each other. For example, for "TAACGC" the number is 6 - 5 for T and other letters and 1 more for the last "GC".
    If some subsequnces have the same numbers of inversion then use the order as they were in the original sequence.
    And the last join these subsequences in one sequences. The final sequnce can be shorter than original.

    Let's look at an example. The given sequence is "ACGGCATAACCCTCGA" and partitioning naumber is 3.
    First is spliting: "ACG", "GCA", "TAA", "CCC", "TCG" and "A". The last "A" is dropping.
    Then count numbers of inversions: "ACG" - 0, "GCA" - 3, "TAA" - 2, "CCC" - 0, "TCG" - 3.
    Sort them: "ACG", "CCC", "TAA", "GCA", "TCG". And join: "ACGCCCTAAGCATCG".

    We have one more rule for this challenge. This is a code golf mission and your main goal is to make your code as
    short as possible. The shorter your code, the more points you earn. Your score for this mission is dynamic and
    directly related to the length of your code. For reference, scoring is based on the number of characters used. 20
    characters is the maximum allowable and it will earn you zero points. For each character less than 200, you earn 1
    point. For example for 150 character long code earns you 50 points.
    In this mission we count whitespaces, but don't count indents (newline characters too).
