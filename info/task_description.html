    When studying a nucleic acid sequence, a succession of letters is used to indicate the order of nucleotides within a
    DNA (using GACT) or RNA (GACU) molecule. For this mission we are specifically interested in DNA and the "GACT"
    sequence. The possible letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand — adenine,
    cytosine, guanine, thymine — covalently linked to a phosphodiester backbone.

<p>
    For this mission you should split a sequence in several sections by length, sort them by number of inversions and
    join them into one sequence again.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of letters "A", "C", "G" and "T" and length of subsequences. First you need split the given
    sequence by the given length. If last part is shorter, then drop it. Then sort these subsequences by numbers of the
    inversion. The number of inversion is a number of pairs of entries that are out of the alphabetic order with respect
    to each other. For example, for "TAACGC" the number is 6 - 5 for T and other letters and 1 more for the last "GC".
    If some subsequences have the same numbers of inversion then use the order as they were in the original sequence.
    Lastly join these subsequences in one sequences. The final sequence can be shorter than original.

<p>
    Let's look at an example. The given sequence is "ACGGCATAACCCTCGA" and partitioning number is 3. First is splitting:
    "ACG", "GCA", "TAA", "CCC", "TCG" and "A". The last "A" is dropping. Then count numbers of inversions: "ACG" - 0,
    "GCA" - 3, "TAA" - 2, "CCC" - 0, "TCG" - 2. Sort them: "ACG", "CCC", "TAA", "TCG", "GCA". And join:
    "ACGCCCTAATCGGCA".

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A sequence as a string and a partitioning number as an int.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sorted sequences as a string.

    These concepts can be applied to bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field which develops methods and tools for
    understanding biological data.
